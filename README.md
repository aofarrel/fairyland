This is a proposed public test repository for rapid testing of certain workflows. **Absolutely no gurantees or warranties are made about the workflows contained herein, as they are still in development.** Do not run anything in here on "real data."

Developers should **not** use this as their development branch. Instead, it should import workflows from elsewhere using a https import pointing at a specific commit, or by manually mirroring from elsewhere. Use this only for rapid testing. Branches will be pruned regularly. Do not use this as a backup.
